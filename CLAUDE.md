# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Basic

- Always use `pnpm` as package manager.
- Always use `Context7 MCP` when working with libraries. Use it to get latest documentation for a library, such as Next.js, React, TailwindCSS, etc.
- Prefer using `eslint` and `prettier` to format your code.
- Don't auto commit and auto push unless I ask you to.
